## POLVERINE_BLINK

This is the simplest application of all, but it still can be useful to:

- verify that your development environment is configured correctly and can compile applications for ESP32-S3 and Polverine
- verify you can connect to Polverine using USB
- verify that you can upload and debug firmware on Polverine (Windows user warning: your windows installation might require to change USB drivers, see [README](../README.md).
- verify that Polverine is working


This simple application can also be the starting point to learn how to program and debug Polverine and ESP32 with PlatformIO in Visual Studio Code.
